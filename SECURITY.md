## Security

Sowpal takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Sowpal](https://github.com/sowpalai), [Stateless Technology](https://github.com/statelesstechnology), 

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Sowpal-owned repository that meets [Sowpal's definition of a security vulnerability](https://sowpal.xyz/security.md/definition), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Sowpal Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://github.com/sowpalai/demo-repository/issues](https://github.com/sowpalai/demo-repository/issues).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [sowpal.xyz/msrc](https://www.sowpal.xyz/msrc).

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
